         <h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome!</h1>
         <p><strong>If you're here because you're checking out my web development portfolio, you can also follow the link to the source code at the bottom of the page with the copyright and refer to the README file.</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Erin, and I'm a lay practitioner of theravada Buddhism and a web developer. 
            I made Dhamma Helper because, while there are some wonderful meditation apps and websites
            out there, they all seemed to be missing a few key features that I thought could improve 
            my practice immensely. 
        </p>
        <p>I have always wanted to have the option of being able to record any reflections 
            and observations I had noticed during my sit - to keep a meditation diary, in other words. 
            Dhamma Helper allows account holders to do exactly that, with the ability to 
            edit the entry for up to 24 hours after the end of the meditation. If you prefer to express 
            your thoughts through speech, you can also record yourself for up to two minutes. You can 
            revisit your entries/recordings at any time. On the "Home" page, you may send friend requests 
            to other users, and these friends can view and/or listen to any journal entries you have 
            chosen to share with friends.
        </p>
        <p>Account holders are also able to view various statistics on their app use - the greatest number 
            of days in a row they have meditated, their average length of meditation, average minutes 
            per day, and so on. This is offered not in a spirit of competitiveness, but rather in order
            to help users reflect on their practice and more easily notice habits.
        </p>
        <p>I have often found using pre-set times for my meditation to be unconducive to 
            mindfulness. If you're prone to impatience, like I am, knowing exactly how long 
            your meditation is going to take can make your mind start to wander unhelpfully ("Is it 
            almost over? It feels like it's been... about 20 minutes. Only 10 to go!" etc.) I thought 
            that being able to set a window of time, 15 to 30 minutes, for example, and then sitting 
            down to some unknown amount of time within that window, would be a good way to 
            mitigate this tendency. Dhamma Helper implements this on the "Meditation" page, where you 
            can select whether you would like to meditate for a randomized or a pre-set amount of time. 
            This feature is available whether or not you have created an account.
        </p>
        <p>Whoever you are, and for whatever reason you're here: may you be happy, may you be healthy,
            may you be safe, and may you be free from suffering!
        </p>
